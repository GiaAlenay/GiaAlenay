Who am I?

I am a Full Stack Developer with the greatest will and desire to expand my knowledge in the field of technology.
My history with programming begins after many failed attempts to find the professional career of my dreams, when I wrote my first line of code I felt that I was capable of doing magic and little by little I discovered how frustrating and exciting it is to solve a problem. using just lines of code and logic.


What am I currently working on?

Currently, I am developing a project similar to a social network for programmers where they can share experiences and tips among themselves, at the same time I have been studying Python, because since I learned about programming I have been very interested in artificial intelligence, all this while I am looking for an opportunity to start my working life.
 
	
what is my goal?

I want to become someone who makes outstanding contributions to the world of technology and programming.
Contribute and give the best of me in all the jobs in which I perform, learn other technologies, learn from those around me and learn from my mistakes, I want to become someone who, when someone gives advice or points out a fault, admit that I was wrong and learn from it without feeling that my ego has been damaged, this way I can guide more programmers to do the same.


What technologies do I use?
